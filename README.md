## 4. Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 3 board 
- Raspberry Pi Camera (B) Rev 2.0 (Rpi Cam)
- Two DC motors
- Two wheels
- Motor Driver Shield (L298N)
- 7805 IC (Voltage Regulator)
- Li-Po battery
- DC switch

## 5. Software Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS
- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)
- OpenVPN (for remote operation)

## 6. Installation and Setup

### Raspberry Pi OS Installation:
1. Download Raspberry Pi OS from the official website raspberrypi.com.
2. Flash the OS onto an SD card using a tool like Etcher (https://etcher.balena.io/).
3. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
4. Follow the on-screen setup instructions to configure the OS.
5. Assign a static IP address during the setup process. If you have difficulty in assigning the static IP address, click here and follow the instructions: https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/static-ip-raspberry-pi

### Installing OpenCV:
- Use the following commands to install OpenCV:
  
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
  

### Installing OpenVPN (Optional):
- Follow the documentation provided by OpenVPN for installation and configuration: https://openvpn.net/

## 7. Project Implementation

### Hardware Setup:

1. **Pi Camera Module**:
   - The Pi Camera Module connects directly to the dedicated camera port on the Raspberry Pi board. No additional wiring is needed.

2. **DC Motors and Wheels**:
   - Two DC motors are typically connected to a motor driver shield. The motor driver shield is not directly mentioned in the code, but it's assumed to be connected.
   - **Motor Driver Shield (L298N)**:
     - **Motor A (Left Motor)**:
       - Input 1: GPIO 22
       - Input 2: GPIO 27
     - **Motor B (Right Motor)**:
       - Input 3: GPIO 17
       - Input 4: GPIO 23

3. **7805 Voltage Regulator**:
   - The 7805 IC is used for voltage regulation but is not directly interfaced with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. It's part of the power supply circuitry for the motors and other components.

4. **Li-Po Battery**:
   - The Li-Po battery is used as the power source for the motors and the Raspberry Pi. It connects to the appropriate input terminals on the motor driver shield and to the Raspberry Pi for power.

5. **DC Switch**:
   - The DC switch is used to turn the power supply on/off. It's part of the power circuitry and is not connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

### Software Setup:

- The software setup involves configuring the Raspberry Pi OS, installing OpenCV for computer vision, and optionally setting up OpenVPN for remote operation. 

### Running the Code:

- Once the hardware and software are set up, you can run the provided Python code on the Raspberry Pi.
- The code captures video from the Pi Camera Module and processes it to detect and track objects based on color.
- The robot's movement is controlled based on the position and size of the detected object.
- You can observe the robot's behavior and interaction with objects in real-time.

**Note:** Be sure to follow safety precautions when working with the hardware, especially when handling power components and motor connections.

## 8. Conclusion

The Smart Color-Based Object Tracking Robot is an exciting project that showcases the integration of computer vision, robotics, and remote control using the Raspberry Pi. Its potential applications are diverse, ranging from industrial automation to augmented reality. By following the outlined hardware and software requirements, installation steps, and implementation process, this project opens up a world of possibilities for innovation in the field of computer science engineering.
